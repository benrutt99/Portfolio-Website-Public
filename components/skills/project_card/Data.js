    popupDescription: `As the culminating project of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp 
      I designed and developed a dynamic website dedicated to campgrounds. 
      This interactive platform empowers users to create personalized accounts, 
      discover a vast selection of campsites, contribute new ones, and provide 
      valuable feedback through reviews. To build the website, I utilized Vanilla 
      Javascript and integrated custom EJS templates with Bootstrap to create a 
     user-friendly front-end. On the back-end, I used MongoDB with Mongoose to efficiently store and manage user and 
      campground data. Additionally, I leveraged the Cloudinary API to store campground
       photos and the Mapbox API to create cluster maps of available campgrounds.
        To ensure secure user authentication, I used Passport and JOI.`,
